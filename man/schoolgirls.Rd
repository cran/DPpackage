\title{The Heights of Schoolgirls}
\description{
  This data set consider growth information of 20 preadolescent schoolgirls reported by Goldstein 
  (1979, Table 4.3, p. 101). The height of girls was measured on a yearly basis from age 6 to 10. 
  The measurements are given at exact years of age, some having been previously adjusted to these. 
  Further, the girls were classified according to the height of their mother into three categories: 
  short mothers, medium mothers and tall mothers.
